Hello, I'm Derek. I am teaching myself data analytics and learning the necessary skills to break into this field. 

Along this jorney, I will be adding a few projects along the way that will hopefully be useful and help me progress. My step along the way is taking my to the Analyst Builder Bootcamp created by Alex Freberg. 

- 🔭 I’m just completed my Google Data Analytics Professional certificate in June 2025. 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on SQL, Tableau and Excel. I will also be including Python into my list of skillsets.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with growing my knowledge of data analytics and future employment opportunities.
