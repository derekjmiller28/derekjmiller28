## 📂 Highlight Projects

### 1️⃣ Excel Analysis – Ecommerce Sales Dashboard
A beginner-friendly Excel project where I explored a small dataset and practiced core analyst skills.

- **Goal:** Extract raw data to generate an interactive dashboard that can convert data into useful business insights. 
- **What I did:**  
  - Cleaned and organized raw data (removed duplicates, standardized formats)  
  - Built pivot tables to summarize key metrics  
  - Created charts to highlight trends and patterns  
- **Key takeaway:**
  - Order volume is evenly distributed across countries, indicating balanced global demand  
  - Campaign performance varies significantly by country, suggesting the need for localized marketing strategies
  - Conversion from visit to order is ~18%, indicating optimization opportunities in the purchase funnel

### 2️⃣ SQL Analysis – SQL Sales Analysis: Revenue, Top Products, and Order Insights 
A foundational SQL project where I focused on writing clear queries and answering practical questions.

- **Goal:** Analyzed sales data to understand total revenue, order volume, and customer behavior, and identify which products and categories drive the most value.  
- **What I did:**  
  - Wrote SQL queries to calculate core performance metrics, including total revenue, total number of orders, and average order value (AOV)  
  - Analyzed product-level performance to find which categories generate the most revenue, which products sell in the highest quantities, and the top 10 products by revenue.
  - Examined the distribution of order statuses and calculated the percentage of orders that were returned. 
- **Key takeaway:** The key takeaway from this analysis is that a small set of product categories and individual products drive the majority of revenue and volume, while overall metrics like AOV, average quantity per order, and unique customers provide a clear baseline for typical sales behavior and performance. These insights, combined with the distribution of order statuses and return rates, highlight both the strongest revenue drivers and potential operational issues around fulfillment and returns.
